# Tensorflow 2 re-implementation of four-stage Scene Text Recognition 

| [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01906) | [training and evaluation data](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark#download-lmdb-dataset-for-traininig-and-evaluation-from-here) |

The most portions of code are borrowed from the official implementation [here](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark).

## ToDo List
- [ ] Implement Spatial Transformer Network module for curved-text. 
- [x] Implement Feature Extraction module.
- [x] Implement Sequence Modeling module.
- [ ] Implement Prediction module.
- [ ] Document for Installation
- [ ] Trained models.
- [ ] Document for testing and training.
- [ ] Evaluation.
- [ ] Demo script.
- [ ] Convert to tflite.
